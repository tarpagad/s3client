# S3 Web Client 🚀

A high-performance, secure, and beautiful web-based S3 client built with Next.js and deployed on Cloudflare Workers. Manage your Amazon S3 buckets and files with a native-like desktop experience directly in your browser.

## ✨ Features

### 🔐 Security First
- **AES-GCM Encryption**: AWS credentials are encrypted at rest using industry-standard AES-256-GCM.
- **Stateless Architecture**: Credentials are stored in secure, HTTP-only cookies, ensuring your keys never touch our persistent storage. No database registration required.

### 📁 Advanced File Explorer
- **Native Experience**: Breadcrumb navigation, folder simulation, and rich file-type icons.
- **Dual View Modes**: Switch between a detailed **List View** and a visual **Grid View**.
- **Context Actions**: Right-click (or 3-dot menu) for quick access to renaming, deleting, and sharing.
- **Optimistic UI**: Instant feedback on file operations with automatic server rollback on failure.

### 🖼️ Universal Previews
- **Instant Viewing**: Preview files without downloading.
- **Supported Formats**:
  - **Images**: High-quality image viewer.
  - **PDFs**: Embedded document viewer.
  - **Code/Text**: Interactive viewer with syntax-friendly formatting (JS, TS, Python, JSON, etc.).

### ⚙️ User Customization
- **Persistent Preferences**: Save your preferred view mode and items per page in your profile.
- **Smart Pagination**: Server-side pagination handles large buckets (thousands of objects) with ease.
- **Sorting**: Toggle between newest and oldest files at a glance.

### ⚡ Performance Optimized
- **Scalable Listing**: Uses S3 `ContinuationToken` for efficient paged fetching.
- **ACL Batching**: Concurrency-limited processing to prevent socket capacity issues.
- **Cloudflare Ready**: Built for the edge with **OpenNext** and Cloudflare Workers.
